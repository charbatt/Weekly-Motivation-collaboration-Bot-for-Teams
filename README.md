# Weekly-Motivation-collaboration-Bot-for-Teams-Slack
Provides weekly scheduled motivational updates tailored for Teams including a GIF

This is a PowerShell script that promotes team collaboration and morale by sharing daily motivational messages and GIFs in Microsoft Teams. The bot dynamically calculates the countdown to Friday and posts weekday-specific motivational content to keep your team engaged and inspired.

**Features**

Daily Countdown to Friday: Automatically calculates the number of days until Friday and shares it with your team.

Motivational GIFs: Fetches random GIFs from Giphy based on the theme of each weekday (e.g., "motivation" for Monday, "celebration" for Friday).

Microsoft Teams Integration: Posts messages directly to Microsoft Teams using adaptive cards via a webhook.

Customizable Themes: Tags for GIFs can be tailored to match your team's preferences.

**How It Works**

The script determines the current day of the week in AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time).

It calculates how many days are left until Friday.

A random GIF is fetched from Giphy based on a predefined tag for the day.

The script formats a motivational message and sends it to Microsoft Teams via a webhook.
